INSTALLATION:
-------------

To install Wysteria, cd into the src directory and run following command:

terminal>./build.sh

This script builds the GMW library (to execute boolean circuits), Z3
SMT solver (to do refinement type checking for Wysteria programs), and
the Wysteria interpreter and type checker.

RUNNING EXAMPLES:
------------------

The examples directory contains 3 sample programs, the main function
of which is generic in the number of parties.

1. mill.wy : Millionaire application.
2. gps.wy  : Nearest neighbor application.
3. spa.wy  : Second-price auction

To run each of these, for let's say three parties, one needs to start
three instances of the interpreter: one for each party. An instance of
the interpreter consists of a GMW server and the Wysteria interpreter
itself.

All the following commands should be run from the src directory in the
checkout.

To start GMW servers, run following commands (in different terminals,
if possible):

./mpc.exe 9000 3 addresses.txt 0 10000

./mpc.exe 9001 3 addresses.txt 1 10000

./mpc.exe 9002 3 addresses.txt 2 10000

Once the servers are successfully started, you should see a "Server
Ready" message on each terminal.

Once this is done, run following 3 commands, again in 3 different
terminals if possible:

./bin/wysteria --i-am \!Alice --gmw-port 9000 examples/mill.wy

./bin/wysteria --i-am \!Bob --gmw-port 9001 examples/mill.wy

./bin/wysteria --i-am \!Charlie --gmw-port 9002 examples/mill.wy

After the third command is run, you should see the secure computation
output for each party.

(To run a different example, follow all the steps above, just change
the filename to the example)
