This is an install guide written by Arjun Narayan.

To install Wysteria, you need the following dependencies installed:

0. Note, if you are on OS X, you need to install z3 separately. I
recommend downloading a precompiled z3, available from
http://z3.codeplex.com/releases/view/101918.

1. OCaml version 4.02.0 or higher. Note that OCaml 3.2 and lower will
not work. You also need OCamlyacc, OCamllex, etc. These should be
installed by default when you install OCaml, but that varies according
to your distribution.

The locations of your OCaml and associated binaries (such as OCamllex
and OCamlyacc) should be in your path.

2. z3. A version of z3 is provided with this distribution (4.3.1),
under z3. To build z3, follow the instructions under z3/README. 

z3 on OS X: Note that the provided z3 version does not compile on OS X
(this is a known z3 bug. The z3 developers suggest using 4.3.2 or
higher, where this is fixed). If you are on OS X, separately download
and install z3. Before proceeding to step (4), you need to copy the z3
binary from the compiled location to src/.

3. The GMW Secure Multiparty Computation implementation. This is also
provided with this distribution, under gmw/.

To build GMW, run "make" under gmw/.

Copy the file gmw/mpc.exe to the src/ directory (not the src/
directory inside gmw/, copy it to wysteria/src/).

4. With these dependencies installed, cd to the src/ directory, and
run "make.sh".
